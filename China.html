            <h2>Working in the United States: Recent Trend of Employment-Based U.S. Green Card Application</h2>
            Foreign workers apply for U.S. green card through Employment-Based immigration visa. The last step of this process, namely the filing of “Adjustment of Status”, is tightly regulated by “Visa Bulletin” to control the application numbers each month. Last October, there was a <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin/2021/visa-bulletin-for-october-2020.html">significant advancement</a> of Visa Bulletin, opening up a big window for application submission. So, are there many more applications submitted since then? Data shown here were downloaded (as of 7/24/2021) from a website called <a href="https://www.trackitt.com/usa-immigration-trackers/i485-eb">"Trackitt"</a>, where users share their data points of green card applications <em>(please note that this is not official data and bias may exist).</em> For simplicity, only data of fiscal year 2020 and 2021 (starting at October 1st of the previous year) are shown here, and the denied or rejected cases (usually due to filing errors) were removed from the analysis.

        <p>This chart shows applications from China. How is this compared with applications from all countries or India that you saw before? Note that although the total number is much less (we keep the axis the same for these different charts so it's easier to campare among them), there is still an obvious peak in October 2020 (in fact, around 15-fold increase).

            <h2>Working in the United States: Recent Trend of Employment-Based U.S. Green Card Application</h2>
            Foreign workers apply for U.S. green card through Employment-Based immigration visa. The last step of this process, namely the filing of “Adjustment of Status”, is tightly regulated by “Visa Bulletin” to control the application numbers each month. Last October, there was a <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin/2021/visa-bulletin-for-october-2020.html">significant advancement</a> of Visa Bulletin, opening up a big window for application submission. So, are there many more applications submitted since then? Data shown here were downloaded (as of 7/24/2021) from a website called <a href="https://www.trackitt.com/usa-immigration-trackers/i485-eb">"Trackitt"</a>, where users share their data points of green card applications <em>(please note that this is not official data and bias may exist).</em> For simplicity, only data of fiscal year 2020 and 2021 (starting at October 1st of the previous year) are shown here, and the denied or rejected cases (usually due to filing errors) were removed from the analysis.

        <p>This chart shows applications from the Rest of World (ROW; all countries except India and China). Similarly to China, there were much less cases compared to India, but there was still an obvious increase in October 2020 (around 4 fold compared with before that), just not as dramatic as applications from India. This is the end of this slideshow. Feel free to go back to previous pages:</p>

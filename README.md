In the United States, foreign workers apply for green cards through so-called Employment-Based immigration visa. The last step of this process, namely the filing of the “I-485” form, is tightly regulated by “Visa Bulletin” to limit the application numbers each month. The Visa Bulletin regulates applications by the countries the applicants come from. For example, the major categories of Employment-Based applications are: India, China, and Rest of World (ROW). Last October, the Visa Bulletin had a significant advancement, meaning that it opened a big window for I-485 application submission. Through this narrative visualization, users can learn that indeed there is a huge (~ 30 fold) increase of I-485 applications in October 2020. Please go ahead to check out the data and follow my instructions to find out which applicants contribute the most the increase of applications.
